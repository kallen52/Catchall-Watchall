# Catchall-Watchall
Kent State Intro to Database System Design project for Spring of 2021.

## To Run:
Navigate to your C:\xampp\htdocs folder and paste this folder in. Run the same way the instructor showed us in class.

## To Edit:
To edit make sure to create a new branch and edit code there. If you want to run it while you're making changes you might want to edit from the htdocs folder instead and then just replace the files in your branch when you want to commit.
